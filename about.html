      <h3>Front-end Developer<span>&</span>Pharmacist</h3>
      <p>Hi, I’m Francis Okumo Alex, a passionate front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and Python. I thrive on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences that connect creativity with functionality. As a pharmacy degree holder and a medical student at Delta State University, Abraka, my unique background blends healthcare knowledge with tech, allowing me to approach problem-solving from a multidisciplinary perspective.

        I’m driven by the desire to create digital solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also enhance the overall user experience. Whether it's through personal projects, freelancing, or academic pursuits, I’m constantly refining my skills and staying updated with the latest trends in web development.
        
        When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new medical research or volunteering in healthcare initiatives. I’m always excited to connect with others and explore how technology can make a real-world impact!</p>
